Clear Separation of Concerns:
	Order: Only manages order data
	OrderDisplay: Handles how orders are displayed
	OrderRepository: Manages storing and retrieving orders
Improved Maintainability:
	If we need to change how orders are displayed, we only modify OrderDisplay
	If we need to change storage (e.g., from file to database), we only modify OrderRepository
Better Testability:
	Each class can be tested independently
	We can mock dependencies when testing
Easier to Extend:
	We can add new display formats without changing the Order class
	We can add new storage methods without affecting other functionality
This simpler example shows how even in basic scenarios, applying SRP leads to more maintainable and flexible code.
