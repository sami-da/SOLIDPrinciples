Single Responsibility: Each class now has a single responsibility:
	- UserValidator handles validation.
	- UserRepository handles data persistence.
	- EmailService handles email notifications.
UserManager orchestrates the process.
Testability: Each class can be tested independently.
Maintainability: Changes to one responsibility (e.g., validation rules) won’t affect others.
Extensibility: Adding new features (e.g., logging) is easier without modifying existing classes.
