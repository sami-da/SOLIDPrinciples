Loose Coupling: High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
Flexibility: Easy to switch implementations without changing the OrderProcessor
Testability: Easy to mock dependencies for unit testing
Maintainability: Changes to one implementation don't affect other parts of the system
Extensibility: New implementations can be added without modifying existing code
