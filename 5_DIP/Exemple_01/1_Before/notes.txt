OrderProcessor directly depends on concrete implementations (EmailNotifier and SqlOrderRepository)
It's tightly coupled, making it hard to:
	Switch to different notification methods (SMS, push notifications)
	Change database technology
	Unit test the OrderProcessor class
Changes in low-level modules might affect the high-level module
