Split Interfaces:

The IOrderService interface is split into smaller, more specific interfaces (IOrderProcessor, IDiscountCalculator, IInvoiceGenerator, and IEmailNotifier).
Each class implements only the interfaces it needs.
Adherence to ISP:

InStoreOrderService no longer depends on the IEmailNotifier interface, avoiding unnecessary implementation of irrelevant methods.
Flexibility:

Adding new functionality (e.g., SMS notifications) can be done by creating a new interface (ISmsNotifier) without affecting existing classes.
